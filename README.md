## Installation

1. To begin installation, you must ensure that "Developer mode" is enabled in your chrome extensions. To do this, navigate to `chrome://extensions/` in your browser, and click the toggle icon in the top right. You will also need a .zip file extractor, such as WinRAR or 7zip.

2. Download this repository as a .zip file. At the top of this page, there is a green button that says "Code". Click it, and select "Download ZIP" from the dropdown menu.

3. Open the downloaded .zip file, click into the folder that says `Underdog-BestBall-Completed-Exposure-master`, then again into the `zip` folder. Select the .zip file and extract it somewhere on your computer.

4. Navigate back to `chrome://extensions/` in your browser. In your operating system's file explorer, select that .zip file you just extracted, then drag & drop it onto the chrome extension page. You should now see the extension on that page.

5. To use the extension, click the puzzle-piece looking icon in the top right of Google Chrome, and "pin" the extension. Once you see it in the list of extension icons.

## Usage

1. Log into your Underdog account on `www.UnderdogFantasy.com`.

2. Click on the `Drafts` tab along the top of the page.

3. Ensure `Completed` is selected just below the heading.

4. Choose the tournament you'd like to extract the results for.

5. Click the `B` Chrome extension button that is pinned to your extension bar.

6. Save resulting CSV file.

Note: You'll have to do this for each tournament individually. This was done so that if a tournament is max entered, you don't keep getting the exposures from it over and over as this is run.
